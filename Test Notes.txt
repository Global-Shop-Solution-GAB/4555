here is what i want to do to test this:

enter 2 work orders that have a part on it that we dont have stock in. enter the costs different on each part, with 2 different required dates. 

enter a sales order for the same part, with an even different cost.

enter 3 vendor quotes 
1 - beats the lowest cost requirement, but not lead time
2 - doesnt beat the lowest cost, but is within lead time

at this point we run the program, and the lowest requirement cost should appear.

3 - meets the lowest cost, AND lead time.


part = TP 29AUTOPU
